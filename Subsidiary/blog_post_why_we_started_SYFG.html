                    <p>Hi all, <br> <br>

my name is Andrew Oldfield, and I am the founder of Share Your Farming Gear (SYFG).  The genesis for SYFG came from looking at my parents farming operation while I was studying engineering at university, and trying to think about how I could use my skills to help people.  Farming was what I had grown up on, and I thought what I was learning at university could be applied there.  I thought I saw that our operation was overcapitalised with expensive machinery we saw we needed to own machinery to achieve the quality and timeliness in our cropping operations that we required.  However, the large machinery costs we incurred were difficult to defray across a relatively small cropping operation.  </p>
                    <p>
We already shared several items of secondary plant with neighbours, but we didn't share any main items of gear because timeliness was so important to us.  Even the items that we did share spent almost as much time in the shed as the things we owned individually because they were low use items only shared between a few farmers.  These concerns over timeliness were (and are) very real, and they aren't trivial to solve. However, it seemed to me that many of the problems associated with sharing machinery were mathematically relatively easy to solve, and that a business delivered over the internet would be able to achieve sufficient scale to deliver these solutions to individual operators at an attractive price.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Scheduling Certainty, Trust, and Complex Relationships</strong><br>
                        The first (and probably biggest) problem with sharing machinery is being certain that you can be certain that you will have the piece of machinery when you need it.  The second biggest problem is being able to trust the person or party that you're considering sharing a piece of machinery with.  The third is finding a simple way to manage the relationship.  SYFG Has been designed to address these concerns in a number of ways:
                        <ol>
                    <li><strong>Matching farmers with compatible schedules.</strong>  When you search for operators to share machinery with through SYFG, you search a far bigger pool than you otherwise would, making it eaier to find a better match for your requirements.</li>
                            <li><strong>Availability insurance.</strong> We believe sharing arrangments that are properly arranged are win-win, and </li>
                    <li><strong>Trust.</strong>  Have you heard the saying 'good fences make good neighbours'?  At SYFG we believe that good agreements make good partners.  So we do 2 things to improve your machinery agreements.  We provide objective, third party analysis of your machinery, cropping programs and machinery usage to project and measure where the costs and benefits accrue in an agreement.  This makes it clear what each party is agreeing to, and who owes what to whom.  We then provide free or cheap contracts to codify these agreements so that there is a legal certainty to any sharing relationship conducted through SYFG.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplifying complexity.</strong> The last thing SYFG wants to do is increase the complexity of your work.  Sharing machinery should be simple and seamless, and we'll do our best to help with payment as well as all the documentation you'll need at tax time.</li>
                    </ol>
                        
</p>

        <p>As we develop SYFG over the next months we look forward to engaging with you and providing you a service that will increase your profitability!
                
                </p>
